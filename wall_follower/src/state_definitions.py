#Here is where you can define all of your states in a clever way to make your code more readable.
#Think of all the states your robot could be in if thrown randomly into a world.
#Currently the code is set up for a variable name being equal to an integer like:


WONDERING = 0
FOLLOWING = 1
TURNING = 2


#for each of your states.
